I created my first game using dsa logics , and it was a whole new experience to learn something new which obviously helped to improve my topics and critical thinking abiltiy.
The GAME description:-

💣 Minesweeper Game in C++

A simple console-based Minesweeper game built in C++, using basic DSA concepts and recursion for revealing cells.
This project helped me understand 2D arrays, recursion, and logic-building in depth.


🎯 Game Objective


The goal is simple:

Reveal all cells that are not mines (9).

Avoid revealing any mine — or 💥 BOOM! Game Over!


⚙️ How It Works


The board is a 2D grid (size n × n), containing:

Randomly placed mines ('9')

Numbered cells ('1'–'8') showing how many mines are around them

Empty cells ('0')

The player chooses a cell to reveal (r) or flag (f):

r row col → Reveal the cell

f row col → Flag the cell as a suspected mine

If a mine is revealed → Game Over!

If all non-mine cells are revealed → You Win! 🎉


🧠 Concepts Used


2D Vectors for board representation


Randomization using rand() and srand(time(0))

Recursion for revealing empty areas

Visited Matrix to avoid infinite recursion

Input Validation for 1-based indexing
